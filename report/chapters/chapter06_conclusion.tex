\section{Outlook}

\textbf{Text Classification}

An example is text classification for which word embeddings can be used to 
map text to an image:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
    Imagine the following word vectors obtained by GloVe:
    \[
    \begin{array}{c|ccc}
      A & 0.1 & 0.2 & 0.1 \\
      B & 0.2 & 0.5 & 0.3 \\
      C & 0.9 & 0.7 & 0.3 \\
      D & 0.4 & 0.8 & 0.1
    \end{array} \ \ \Rightarrow \ \ w_i \in \mathbb{R}^3, \ d = 3
    \]
    Note that word vectors created by GloVe are organized as rows within the matrix
    where the rownames displays the vocabulary of available words.

  \item 
     Now we have a given text:
    \[
    \mathrm{A\ B\ A\ D\ B\ C}
    \]    

  \item  
    Next, each word in the text is mapped to the corresponding
    word vector to obtain a matrix for the given text:
    \[
    \begin{array}{cccccc}
    \mathrm{A} & \mathrm{B} & \mathrm{A} & \mathrm{D} & \mathrm{B} & \mathrm{C} \\
    \downarrow & \downarrow & \downarrow & \downarrow & \downarrow & \downarrow \\
    0.1 & 0.2 & 0.1 & 0.4 & 0.2 & 0.9 \\
    0.2 & 0.5 & 0.2 & 0.8 & 0.5 & 0.7 \\
    0.1 & 0.3 & 0.1 & 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.3
    \end{array}
    \]
  
  \item 
    This matrix can be used to create an image out of the 
    given text by translating the matrix to an image:

{\Huge IMAGE}
%<center>
%<img width="800px" src="images/stupid_image.png" />
%</center>
\end{enumerate}



The following images were generated from the introduction of Principia 
Mathematica by Sir Isaac Newton and Elements of Statistical Learning, 
as well as from Sonnet 18 by William Shakespear:

%<img width="800px" src="images/text_images.png" />

\section{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 
    With GloVe it is possible to create meaningful word embeddings.

  \item 
    \cite{pennington2014glove} compared several models on the word analogy task, 
    whereas GloVe outperforms the others.
  
  \item 
    But accuracy of word analogy task depends not only on the dimension, but 
    also on the corpus.

  \item 
    Use servers or pcs with huge computing power to train GloVe due to 
    the need of huge corpora an computing time!
