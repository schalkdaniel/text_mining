# `text_mining`

## Purpose

This repo contains everything I have used, created or take a look at for the 
![text mining seminar at LMU](https://moodle.lmu.de/enrol/index.php?id=3032).

My topic for the seminar is: **GloVe**

This repository conatins:

- `ioslides` for the presentation
- code which I have written
- some other stuff like fancy visualization or a web crawler
- paper and references I have used
- the report written by me

### references

- [Pennington et al.](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1162)

**Please Note:** The presentation and report will be in german since the whole seminar 
is held in german. The code comments and every other stuff which does not appear within
the presentation or report will be in english.

## ToDos

- get into the topic
- create fancy visualization (maybe with `d3.js`, should work perfectly with `ioslides`)
- create the presentation with `ioslides`
- write the report
