# `text_mining`

## Purpose

This repo contains everything I have used, created or take a look at for the 
![text mining seminar at LMU](https://moodle.lmu.de/enrol/index.php?id=3032).

My topic for the seminar is: **GloVe**

This repository conatins:

- `ioslides` for the presentation
- code which I have written
- some other stuff like fancy visualization or a web crawler
- paper and references I have used
- the report written by me

## ToDos

- get into the topic
- write a small *package* 
- create fancy visualization (maybe with `d3.js`, should work perfectly with `ioslides`)
- create the presentation with `ioslides`
- write the report
